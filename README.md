# QtSystemTrayIconMac
QtSystemTrayIconMac is an alternative QSystemTrayIcon implementation for MacOSX. It supports MacOSX specific features such as text next to the tray icon and distinction between dark and light theme, but tries to be as compatible to QSystemTrayIcon as possible.

It has been developed by various people at 9elements. For simplicity, I added just myself in the copyright notice, but it is important to me to give proper credits here.

# Usage
It is available through qt-pods. See here for more info:

Also, you can pull it in manually as a submodule.
